This plugin helps in formatting and checking of shell scripts without the
need for an LSP but still indicating errors and also putting them into
a quickfix list for easy navigation. Everything happens with autocmd on
`BufWritePost` and `InsertLeave`.

Example:

                                                        *sherllock.check()*
sherllock.check()
    Checks your shell script with `shellcheck` for errors, warnings and infos.
    It will open a quickfix list if there are any errors, warnings or infos
    for easy navigation and close the quickfix list if the file is closed.
    They will also be indicated in the sign column.

                                                        *sherllock.format()*

sherllock.format()
    Formats the current buffer using `shfmt`. Make sure to run |sherllock.check|
    before so that there are no errors since the output of shfmt will be
    writen to the current buffer.
